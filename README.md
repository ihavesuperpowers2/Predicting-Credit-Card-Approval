# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approval
Machine Learning regression model to predict whether a credit card will be approved or not.


The dataset I have used is from UCL Machine Learning repository. This is one of my DataCamp projects. I have used Logistic Regression to predict and grid search to optimize it. I was able to achieve 85%(approx) accuracy.
